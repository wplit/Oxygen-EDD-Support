Usually, to customise the default templates/shortcodes for Easy Digital Downloads you need a theme to add the template files to. With this plugin, you don't need a theme. Built especially for [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/) where the theme is completely disabled.

Simply add your customised EDD template files for the checkout shortcodes, purchase history, edit profile etc inside the /edd_templates/ directory inside this plugin.

See [documentation on customising template files in Easy Digital Downloads](https://docs.easydigitaldownloads.com/article/1216-moving-edd-templates-to-your-theme) for reference.
